# Configuration Directory

This directory (`config/`) is where configuration files are stored. You will find example configuration files with the `.env` extension. To set up your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Rename `database.php.env` to `database.php` and configure your database settings.
2. Rename `config.php.env` to `config.php` and configure other application settings.

These files should not be committed to the repository and have been added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
